# Summary

The data visualizations presented via Tableau indicate that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa might be feasible. Although the population is smaller than compared to NYC, there are enough attractions in the city that tourists can choose to bike to for a more scenic and faster-than-walking solution.

## Two additional visualization suggestions to perform include:
- Comparison of age vs. starting and ending locations using area charts.
- A Gantt Bar to compare birth year (age) vs. gender (male, female, unknown) to gain an understanding of the population demographic.
